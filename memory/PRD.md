## User Personas
1. **Site Admin/Staff** - Uses Credit Manager to manage customer credits and subscriptions
2. **Customers** - Use the Dashboard to see appointments, track debts, view credits, refer friends
3. **Team Members** - Staff who use allocated credits from their team owner
4. **Debtors** - People who owe money to customers, receive reminders via SMS/Email

## Core Requirements

- Credit system tracking SMS, Calls, Email credits
- Debt ledger with payment tracking and reminders
- Twilio integration for SMS & Voice calls
- ElevenLabs integration for AI voice
